# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm m1rrozZ.

Welcome to my space on GitHub! This is where I explore, learn, and create. Here's a little bit about me:

- ðŸ‘€ **Interest:** Programming, animation, modeling, editing and experimenting with creative projects.
- ðŸŒ± **Currently studying:** Currently immersing myself in programming languages such as C++, C#, C, Python, diving into libraries, frameworks to realize my ideas.
- ðŸ’» **Objectives:** Take programming apart piece by piece.
- ðŸ“« **How to contact me:** Currently, I can only be contacted via Telegram (@m1rrozZ). I also have my TG channel(https://t.me/m1rrW) where I post my routine, my ideas and their implementation, my thoughts and more.
- âš¡ **Interesting fact:** I treat programming as an art - logical and endlessly creative. ðŸŽ¨

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to chat if you're working on something interesting or just want to share ideas!
